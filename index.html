          <h3>About the visualization</h3>
          <small>
            <ul>
              <li class="fragement" data-fragement-index="1"><strong>Visualizaton & Narration Structure</strong></li>
              <p class="fragement" data-fragement-index="2">This visualizatio follows a hybrid structure that contains the several pages/scenes. It is based on Interactive
                 slideshow technique. In each page/slide, you will find directions and guidance which user can use to move between the slides at any time. 
              </p>
              <li class="fragement" data-fragement-index="3"><strong>Scene Utilization</strong></li>
              <p class="fragement" data-fragement-index="4">The project contains few slides that contains interactive visualizations to convey the message. User can interact 
                with these visualization to see the details of the data. Each visualization is preceded by details and followed by addition details in order to put additional 
                light on the chart and data. These scenes/slides were created using Reveal.js library which provides smooth transition between scenes, maintains coherency and 
                provides rich user experience. The visual elements such as colors, fonts and apperance is consistent throuhout the project.</p>
              <li class="fragement" data-fragement-index="5"><strong>Annotations</strong></li>
              <p class="fragement" data-fragement-index="6">Annotations in this project are represented by tooltips which displays the details of the data points user is interested in. 
                for example, in first stacked bar chart user can see the satellite type, usage and purpose etc. and on the other visualization, displays Operator country, Apogee and 
                Perigee etc. These annotations will appers when user will hover on data elements and will disappers when user move away the mouse.
              </p>
              <li class="fragement" data-fragement-index="7"><strong>Parameters</strong></li>
              <p class="fragement" data-fragement-index="8">There are several parameter used throughout the project and in different form. There are two directonal arrows on each slides
                to navigate back and forth between the slides. User can also use mouse rollers or left and right keys from keyboard to navigate. The Arrow in the right direction will
                always appear to be active and left arrow will not but user can still use left arrow to navigate to previous scenes/slides. Users will start seeing left arrow once 
                they pass first scenes/slides. At the bottom of the page, users can also see the progress bar as well as current slide number.
              </p>
              <li class="fragement" data-fragement-index="9"><strong>Triggers</strong></li>
              <p class="fragement" data-fragement-index="10">All the charts in this projects have trigeers. For the first visualization user can filter the visual by clicking on 
                data labels of the chart. This filters the stacked bar chart and shows only data points which user has selected. By clicking on same label again, user can go back
                to reset mode and can see full data in the chart. In second visualization, there are few buttons on visualization that when pressed, changes the visualization 
                state or change the the visualization all together. For example one button causes chart to switch from grouped bubble chart to scatter plot of same data points.</p>

          <h3>The Dataset</h3>
          <p><small>The dataset used for this visualization is from <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/space-weapons/satellite-database">Union of Concerned Scientst</a> database. 
            This dataset consists of data about all the satellites that orbit the earth today. Assembled by experts at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), the Satellite 
            Database is a listing of the more than 1700 operational satellites currently in orbit around Earth. The database contains 26 types of data for each satellite, including 
            technical information about each satellite (mass, power, launch date, expected lifetime) and its orbit (apogee, perigee, inclination, and period), as well as information 
            on what the satellite is used for, and who owns, operates, and built the satellite.
            Class of orbit etc.

                    The Stacked bar chart in the previous screen shows the satellites currently orbiting the earth and its age. These satellites are broken out by its usage
                    type. Note that these are the satellites that are currently orbiting the earth and functioning. This visual reveals some interesting information that sheds
                    some light on how we have made progress thoughout the years. For example it can be seen from visual that oldest functioning satellite that is still orbiting
                    the Earth was launched 44 years ago by xxx for mix use of Military and Commercial purpose. Many of these old satellites were used for either military orbit
                    commercial purposes. After that we see the trend of more commercial satellites.

              <p>
                <small>
                  Another observation which is somewhat obvious is the increase in number of satellites launched in recent years. We can see that since the 
                  beginning of the century there are constant increase in satellites launched year over year. Majority of these satellites appeares to be used for commercial and
                  military purpose but we see an increase in usage for civil purposes.

              In last chart we see how apogee and perigee are compared for all satellites. Apogee and Perigee are terms which describe aspects of an elliptical orbit of satellites.
              Apogee is the distance when a satellite is at farthest from the Earth and Perigee is the distance when a satellite is at the closest distance from the Earth. 
              These satellites are classified by the purpose it is used for so user can easily distinguish about a particular type of satellite by clicking on label signs.
              This Chart gives us good understanding of how satellites orbits around the Earth and how its path will look like.

            <h3>So what happened in last 4-5 decades...</h3>
            <p><iframe class="juxtapose" src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=03d44e24-e16f-11e5-a524-0e7075bba956" frameborder="0" width="650" height="380"></iframe></p>
            <p><small>As we can see that since the first satellite was launched back in 60's there were only few countries that had satellites let alone the capabilities on launcing 
              the satellite with space launch. In last 4 decades we have seen tremendous growth notn only in number of satellies launched by several coutries but also in what purpose 
              these satellites are used for. As of 2016, countries from virtually every continent have their satellite orbiting the earth. We also see the increase in coutries who have
              space launching capabilities as well.
