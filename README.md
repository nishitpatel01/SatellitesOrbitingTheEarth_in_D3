### Dataset Used
- The dataset used for this visualization is from Union of Concerned Scientst database. This dataset consists of data about all the satellites that orbit the earth today. Assembled by experts at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), the Satellite Database is a listing of the more than 1,700 operational satellites currently in orbit around Earth. The database contains 26 types of data for each satellite, including technical information about each satellite (mass, power, launch date, expected lifetime) and its orbit (apogee, perigee, inclination, and period), as well as information on what the satellite is used for, and who owns, operates, and built the satellite.

### About the Visualization

#### Visualizaton & Narration Structure
- This visualization follows a hybrid structure that contains the several scenes. It is based on Interactive slideshow technique. In each slide, directions and guidance are provided which user can use to move between the slides at any time.
    
#### Scene Utilization
- The project consists of few slides that contains interactive visualizations to convey the message. User can interact with these visualization to see the details of the data elements. Each visualization is followed by addition details in order to put additional light on the chart and data. These scenes were created using Reveal.js library which provides smooth transition between scenes, maintains coherency and provides rich user experience. The visual elements such as colors, fonts and apperance is consistent throuhout the project.
    
#### Annotations
- Annotations in this project are represented by tooltips which displays the details of the data points user is interested in. for example, in first stacked bar chart user can see the satellite type, usage and purpose etc. and on the other visualizations, displays Operator country, Apogee and Perigee etc. These annotations will appers when user will hover on data elements. In zoomable circle pack chart, user will see once they zoom into appropriate circles.
    
#### Parameters
- There are several parameter used throughout the project and in different form. There are two directonal arrows on each slides to navigate between the slides. User can also use mouse rollers or left and right keys from keyboard to navigate. The Arrow in the right direction will always appear to be active and left arrow will not but user can still use left arrow to navigate to previous scenes/slides. At the bottom of the page, users can also see the progress bar as well as current slide number.
    
#### Triggers
- All the charts in this projects have trigeers. For the first visualization user can filter the visual by clicking on data labels of the chart. This filters the stacked bar chart and shows only data points which user has selected. By clicking on same label again, user can go back to reset mode and can see full data in the chart. In second visualization, there are few buttons on visualization that when pressed, changes the visualization state or change the the visualization all together. For example one button causes chart to switch from grouped bubble chart to scatter plot of same data points.
